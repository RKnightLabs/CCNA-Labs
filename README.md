# CCNA Labs

Welcome to my collection of Cisco Packet Tracer labs. I created these labs to showcase the networking knowledge and skills Iâ€™ve developed during my CCNA studies.

## Lab Overview

This repository contains practical Packet Tracer exercises covering key CCNA topics, including:

- Basic Switching and VLAN Configuration  
- Router Setup and Static Routing  
- Inter-VLAN Routing  
- Network Troubleshooting Techniques
- ETC

## File Format

Each lab is saved as a `.pkt` file compatible with Cisco Packet Tracer.

## How to Use

1. Download the `.pkt` file of the lab you want to explore.  
2. Open it in Cisco Packet Tracer to view and interact with the network setup.  
3. Feel free to modify and experiment with the configurations.
