# 🔐 Basic Device Security Lab

This lab demonstrates foundational device security practices using Cisco routers and switches, including password protection, hostname configuration, and encryption techniques.

---

## 🔍 Overview

In this lab, I configured hostnames, secure device access with passwords, enable encryption, and verify password storage security in Cisco IOS.

## 🧰 Devices Used

- 1 Router (`R1`)
- 1 Switch (`SW1`)

## 🔑 Security Configurations Made

 Task                                            Configuration Details                            
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hostname                                        R1 and SW1                                       
 Unencrypted Enable Password                     `enable password CCNA`                           
 View Password in Config                         `show running-config` (before encryption)        
 Enable Password Encryption                      `service password-encryption`                    
 Encrypted Enable Secret Password                `enable secret Cisco`                            
 Test Privileged Access                          `enable` → Password Cisco                       
 View Password Types                             Type 7 (`enable password`), Type 5 (`secret`)    
 Save Configuration                              `copy running-config startup-config`

## 🧪 What I Did

- Renamed devices with proper hostnames
- Set and tested both `enable password` and `enable secret`
- Enabled password encryption to secure existingfuture passwords
- Observed how encrypted passwords appear in the running config
- Noted the encryption types
  - Type 7 Weak (obfuscation)
  - Type 5 Strong (MD5 hash)
- Verified proper security behavior through CLI

---

## 💡 Takeaways

- I understood the difference between `enable password` vs `enable secret`
- I learned how to view and interpret encryption types in configs
- I reinforced why `enable secret` is the preferred secure method
- I practiced essential hardening steps for Cisco devices
- I gained insight into password visibility and encryption on IOS

## 🖥️ How to Open the Lab File

1. 🔽 Download the `.pkt` file from this folder  
   - Click the file  
   - Then click “View Raw” to save it to your machine  
2. 📂 Open it using Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.0 or later recommended)

## 🛠️ Don’t Have Packet Tracer

➡️ Download it for free via Cisco Networking Academy

(Requires a free NetAcad account)

Once opened, you can explore CLI configurations, test login behavior, and check your understanding of secure device access.
