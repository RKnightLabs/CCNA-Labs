# üß† CCNA Subnetting and Static Routing Lab

Welcome to my CCNA lab! This project is part of my journey to mastering fundamental networking concepts. In this lab, I designed and configured a network topology using subnetting, point-to-point routing, and static routing to allow full communication between multiple LANs.

## üßæ Lab Objective

The goal of this lab is to:

- Subnet a single `/24` network into multiple subnets
- Assign IP addresses according to host requirements
- Configure end devices and routers using Cisco IOS
- Establish static routing so all devices can communicate
- Solidify subnetting and routing knowledge using real-world practice

## üßÆ Subnetting Requirements

Original Network: `192.168.5.0/24`  
I used VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) to meet the host requirements efficiently:

| Subnet | Purpose         | Hosts Needed | Subnet Mask     | Address Range            | First Usable IP | Last Usable IP | Broadcast Address |
|--------|------------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| LAN2   | Largest LAN      | 64           | /25 (255.255.255.128) | 192.168.5.0 - 192.168.5.127 | 192.168.5.1     | 192.168.5.126   | 192.168.5.127     |
| LAN1   | Medium LAN       | 45           | /26 (255.255.255.192) | 192.168.5.128 - 192.168.5.191 | 192.168.5.129   | 192.168.5.190   | 192.168.5.191     |
| LAN3   | Small LAN        | 14           | /28 (255.255.255.240) | 192.168.5.192 - 192.168.5.207 | 192.168.5.193   | 192.168.5.206   | 192.168.5.207     |
| LAN4   | Tiny LAN         | 9            | /28 (255.255.255.240) | 192.168.5.208 - 192.168.5.223 | 192.168.5.209   | 192.168.5.222   | 192.168.5.223     |
| P2P    | R1 <--> R2 Link  | 2            | /30 (255.255.255.252) | 192.168.5.224 - 192.168.5.227 | 192.168.5.225   | 192.168.5.226   | 192.168.5.227     |

## üíª IP Address Assignments

| Device | Interface | Assigned IP        |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| PC1    | NIC       | 192.168.5.129      |
| R1     | G0/0      | 192.168.5.190      |
| PC2    | NIC       | 192.168.5.1        |
| R1     | G0/1      | 192.168.5.126      |
| R1     | G0/0/0    | 192.168.5.225      |
| R2     | G0/0/0    | 192.168.5.226      |
| PC3    | NIC       | 192.168.5.193      |
| R2     | G0/0      | 192.168.5.206      |
| PC4    | NIC       | 192.168.5.209      |
| R2     | G0/1      | 192.168.5.222      |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Steps

### 1. Configure Interfaces

Each router and PC was manually assigned an IP from the appropriate subnet. Descriptions and `no shutdown` commands were used to activate the interfaces.

### 2. Static Routing

To ensure end-to-end connectivity, I added static routes on both routers.

#### On R1:
```bash
ip route 192.168.5.192 255.255.255.240 192.168.5.226  ! LAN3
ip route 192.168.5.208 255.255.255.240 192.168.5.226  ! LAN4
On R2:
bash

Edit
ip route 192.168.5.0   255.255.255.128 192.168.5.225  ! LAN2
ip route 192.168.5.128 255.255.255.192 192.168.5.225  ! LAN1
