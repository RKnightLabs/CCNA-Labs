# 📘 Packet Tracer Introduction Lab 

## 📖 Description
This lab demonstrates how to create a basic network diagram in Cisco Packet Tracer using the **Automatically Choose Connection Type** function to connect devices. The topology replicates the diagram shown at **16:40 of the Day 1 video**.

## 🧰 Devices Used
- 2 × Cisco 2911 Routers  
- 2 × Cisco 2960 Switches  
- 2 × Cisco ASA 5505 Firewalls  
- 2 × PCs  
- 2 × Servers  
- 1 × Laptop (used as the "attacker")

## 🔌 Connections Made
- All devices connected using **Packet Tracer’s Automatically Choose Connection Type** function  
- This ensures the correct cable type (straight-through, crossover, or fiber) is selected automatically based on port compatibility  
- Diagram follows the topology shown in the Day 1 video

## 🧪 What I Did
- Selected and placed the required devices in the workspace  
- Used the **Automatically Choose Connection Type** tool to connect devices  
- Verified connections visually in the topology  
- Positioned the attacker laptop correctly in the diagram  
- Practiced identifying how Packet Tracer determines cable types automatically

## 💡 Takeaways
- Learned how to quickly build a topology without manually selecting cable types  
- Understood how Packet Tracer simplifies cabling decisions for beginners  
- Reinforced knowledge of device icons and their roles in a network diagram  
- Observed how firewalls, routers, switches, PCs, servers, and laptops interact in a simple topology

## 🖥️ How to Open the Lab File
1. Download the `.pkt` file from this folder. Click **“View Raw”** to save it.  
2. Open it using **Cisco Packet Tracer** (version 8.0 or later recommended).  
3. If you don’t have Packet Tracer installed:  
   - Download it for free from Cisco’s official website (requires free account):
